## Current

- [ ] Write indetail explanation of Logistic Regression
- [ ] Implement Abstract classes wherever necessary  
 (ps: Python classes will work even if abstract method is not mentioned, 
 so see if it is necessary to implement abstract class/method)

## Backlogs:

- [ ] Add CSV path Directly into the DatasetLoader constructor 
and call csvtoarray inside init method 
- [ ] I have done derivation manually in Regression Function
    - [ ] Create a Derivation Function that will automatically derivate the equation
- [ ]  Derive Euler's Constant
- [ ]  Derive Pi Constant

## Done

- [x] Seperate these Two Algorithms into it's Seperate Files
    - [x] Regression
    - [x] Gradient descent 
- [x] Call these two Algorithms into Linear and Logistic Regression files
- [x] Cleanup Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

- [x]  Figure out where to add DatasetLoader class
